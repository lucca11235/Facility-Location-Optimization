# Facility-Location-Optimization

Welcome to my repository dedicated to solving the Facility Location Optimization problem, a pivotal challenge in operations research and supply chain management. This problem revolves around determining the most strategic locations for facilities (like warehouses, factories, or retail stores) to minimize costs and optimize service efficiency to a set of clients.

## Problem Overview
The Facility Location Optimization problem involves several key components:

- *Facilities:* Places where goods are produced, stored, or sold.
- *Clients:* Endpoints that need the services or goods provided by the facilities.
- *Costs:* Includes various factors such as opening facilities, transportation, and operational expenses.
- *Objective:* To minimize the total cost, which may involve a combination of minimizing the distance clients are from facilities, minimizing the number of facilities, or minimizing the overall operational and transportation costs.

This problem can be modeled in various ways, including but not limited to the Simple Plant Location Problem (SPLP), the Capacitated Facility Location Problem (CFLP), and the Multi-Facility Location Problem (MFLP), each introducing different constraints and complexities.

As of now, the solution presented considers the CFLP model of the problem.

## Solutions
In this repository, I present a collection of innovative solutions to the Facility Location Optimization problem, each designed with efficiency and scalability in mind. My approaches leverage a mix of traditional optimization techniques and modern computational methods, including:

- Heuristic algorithms for quick and effective solutions to complex problems.
- Exact algorithms for smaller instances where precision is paramount.
- Metaheuristic approaches that balance between solution quality and computational feasibility for larger instances.
